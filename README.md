# DiME

**L**arge-scale **T**est**B**ed - **Di**stributed **M**essaging **E**nvironment (short as LTB-DiME or DiME), data exchange environment for [CURENT](https://github.com/CURENT) [Large-scale Testbed](https://github.com/CURENT/ltb2).

Online documentation is available at [DiME](https://ltbdime.readthedocs.io).

# Why DiME

DiME enables **high-concurrency**, **high-volume** **real-time** data exchange in **large-scale power** system simulations using a **shared workspace**.

Furthermore, DiME is compatible with **multiple programming languages** including Python, Matlab, and JavaScript.

Interactions between server and clients in DiME:
