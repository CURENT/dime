# Why DiME

DiME enables **high-concurrency**, **high-volume** **real-time** data exchange in **large-scale power** system simulations using a **shared workspace**.

Furthermore, DiME is compatible with **multiple programming languages** including Python, Matlab, and JavaScript.

Interactions between server and clients in DiME:
